SHAOWEN Q&A

are we supposed to be doing the user stories? - generated by us with consultation based on what info is collected by client  - produce and then run through with ash 

process for requirements gathering? - reference best practice cmmi requirement gathering or ski book - itel it infrastructure library - pick fundamental points and present in a way that is easy to follow - requirements need to be traceable, verifiable as they change, use template for documenting process parts. cmmi shows for each process area a similar process format. template for only some artefacts is required. 

roles like project manager, team leader ect must be defined in document

should ash make the user stories - no we are making them but verify them with ash and document response	

should our process say that we are coming up with user stories? - not really from what I can gather from what she told me

what was our group number - Group SE4A

page 133 of text book - activities roles and artefacts process? section 6.2 (she referenced this wile talking to me) 

don't need a few artefacts in each area of the process

talk about what we think would be done under each process headline and reflect on the process once it's done
