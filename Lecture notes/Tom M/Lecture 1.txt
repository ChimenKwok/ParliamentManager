LECTURE

	life cycle vs process
		software life-cycle
			continuous, customer focus, deliverables, what?
			
		process
			steps, day-to-day, methodology, how?
			
			- "every software has the same life-cycle.(High level - conception, requirements, delivery, death.) but different process."
	

	development cycle
					inception, 		elaboration,     		construction,          		transition (to user)
								^					^	   						^							^
		milestones:			objective          architecture			operational capability				  release
	
		first cycle is "development cycle", subsequent cycles are "evolution cycles"
		
	Challenging the process -
		why this? what if that?
		
	
	Role - Activity  - Artifact
		Engineer (or team) eg System analyst, describe usecase, use case diagram
