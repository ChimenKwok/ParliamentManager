Unifiend Process - Per cycle/ per release
	Inception
	Elaboration
	construction
	Transition
		
	Distinct from  Disciplines eg.
		Requirements
		analysis and desing
		implementation
		testing
		
development cycle vs. Evolution cycle
	- One iteration of the unified process
	development cycle - first time round
	evolution cycle - subsequent releases
	
Iteration
	- sequence of activities encompassed in a plan. 
	- produces or modifies artifacts.
	- can not generally be planned several iterations in advance
	
	how is this different from a "sprint"
		- may not encompass all 4 elements of UP
		- may exist within one phase
		
Factors that influence Process
	life cycle
	application domain
		- how much is on the line?
	Process
		- are you following a defined process?
		- standards
		- models (watefall, agile, spiral)
	people / organisation
		- How big?
		- Existing practices
		- politics

process analysis is designed to figure out if you are doing things the optimum way

	framework describing key elements of effective processes
				
	for meeting

		Functionality
		quality

Process Focus
	vs People Focus
		- people on average are as good as their tringing
	vs Technology Focus
		- 
		
Summary		
	Model - what to do
	Process - how to do it
