SE4 Presentation - Requirements

What we aimed to produce:
	- A Lightweight SRS.
	- Sufficient detail to begin design phase in earnest.


Process Activities: 
(For each activity, show (an excerpt of) the inputs and artifcacts)

	- Iterative process to developing Lightweight SRS
	
	- Elicit requirements from "domain expert" Ashley
		Inputs - domain knowledge
		Artifacts - Notes
	
	- Determine Actors
		Inputs - Notes
		Artifacts - List of Actors.
	
	- Brain storm user stories
		Inputs - Notes, List of Actors
		Artifacts - User Stories for each actor
		
	- Review User Stories
		Inputs - User Stories
		Artifacts - User Stories (Honed)
		
	- Develop Functional Requirements
		Inputs - User Stories
		Artifacts - Functional Requirements List
		
	- Develop Non-Functional Requirements.
		Inputs - Notes
		Artifacts - Non-Functional Requirements List
		
	- Determine Verification Success Criteria.
		Inputs - Functional Requirements List, Non-Functional Requirements List
		Artifacts - Verification Cross Reference Matrix VCRM
		
	- Review
		Inputs - VCRM
		Artifacts - VCRM (Honed)
		
	- Assemble SRS (Current Activity)
		Inputs - Notes, List of Actors, User Stories, Functional Requirements List, Non-Functional Requirements List, VCRM
		Outputs - SRS
		
Outcome:
	- We are ready to assemble the SRS.
	- We have enough detail to ramp up the design phase.
	- Requirements phase is ramping down.
	- We will re-address the requirments, periodically.
